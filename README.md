# Data Science

Data Science is a repository that contains my resources for learning, teaching, and developing materials related to Data Science and (mostly Python-based) programming. The more advanced AI/ML Concepts will be implemented in the Artificial Intelligence folder, which can also be located on this github. 

## Projects

A wide variety of Data Science projects with mostly publicly available (ethically-collected) data from various resources. 

## Exercises

Individual Python Exercises that demonstrate various mathematical concepts that we can implement in Python functions (as well as in Java, C++, etc.)

## Contributing

Pull requests are not generally welcome for developing this material, as the material is developed only by James Pecore as a resource.
That said, pull requests from prospective employers or from students looking to analyze the code used and its functionality are certainly welcome.
