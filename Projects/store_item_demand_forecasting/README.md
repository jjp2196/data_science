# Time Series Forecasting: AI and Deep Learning for Predicting Sales Data

Time Series Forecasting is the process of analyzing individual data-points, each associated with a specific date and time, to observe and predict overall trends within data. In many industries such as sales or insurance, the mitigation and minimization of risk is a key; this method can also predict and evaluate levels of risk. And while a Markov Chain model omits the full history of a dataset— simply focusing on each datapoint’s previous state to make its next prediction — Time Series Forecasting uses the overall history of the data to inform its decision-making.
