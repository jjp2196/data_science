# Pivot Table Maker

This repository contains Python code for analyzing sales data and generating a summary report. The code processes a CSV file containing sales data (train.csv), creates a pivot table to summarize the sales by store and item across different months and years, handles missing values if necessary, and saves the final report as an Excel file.

# Getting Started

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: 
https://github.com/your-username/sales-data-analysis.git
2. Install the required Python dependencies. You can do this using pip:bashCopy codepip install pandas numpy
3. Place your sales data CSV file in the project directory.Modify the sales_data.csv file name in the Python script if your data file has a different name.Run the Python script:bashCopy codepython sales_analysis.py
4. After execution, you will find the generated sales report saved as sales_report.xlsx in the project directory.
